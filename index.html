            <h4>TLDR;</h4>
            <p>In recent research observations of Orion Nebula's protoplanetary disc d203-506, researchers discover that 
                massive stars' UV radiation can significantly impact the formation of planetary systems. The ongoing 
                research continues to reveal more complexities of planetary development and the role of UV radiation in 
                shaping the universe.
            </p>

            <h4>Recent Research</h4>
            <p>A study published by the University of Cologne and it's international research team of scientists utilized 
                the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to explore planetary system formations in the Orion Nebula. By 
                focusing on the protoplanetary disc d203-506, the research team was able to discover the significant role 
                that massive stars play, specifically those that are around 100,000 times brighter than the Sun itself.
            </p>
            <p>The massive stars' influence on planetary formation lies in intense UV radiation, and was found to be a 
                critical factor. Due to the radiation, a Jupiter-like planet was determined by the researchers to be 
                incapable of forming within this particular system, making it evident how delicate the balance is when it 
                comes to planet formation.
            </p>
            <p>UV Radiation isn't a bad factor in planetary formation though. UV Radiation emitted by these stars can 
                either facilitate or hinder planet formation, depending on the specific conditions of the system. The 
                research team also utilized a multidisciplinary approach by combining data from the JWST and the 
                Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), which led to their findings in rapid evaporation processes in the 
                protoplanetary disk. This suggests that the entire disk would evaporate faster, and maybe even faster 
                than the time is takes for a giant planet to even form.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "It is great that so many contributions from the team over the years, including the planning of the 
                observations and the evaluation the data, are bearing fruit in the form of these results that represent 
                a significant step forward in the understanding the formation of planetary systems." &mdash; Dr. Yoko Okada

                <div class="flex-item">
                    <p>Massive stars are fueled by intense nuclear fusion reactions. These reactions emite UV radiation as part of 
                        the electromagnetic spectrum. This high energy plays a crucial factor in the formation and ultimately the 
                        evolution of planetary system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some ways protoplanetary disks may be impacted is through UV radiation causing ionization of gases, 
                        affecting their conductivity and magnetic properties. This ionization process can also influence the overall 
                        structure of the disks, creating features such as spiral arms, as well as losing outer disk layers.

                    <p>By impacting the formation of planetesimals, this affects the building blocks for planets. This involves 
                        the chemistry of protoplanetary disks, and the molecules in the surrounding space. ALtered chemistry ends 
                        up influencing the types and abundances of molecules avaiable for the planet to potentially form.
                    </p>
                    <p>With altered chemistry on a planet, if a planet were to form with the given molecules that survived the 
                        intense radiation, the characteristics of the emerging planet may very well be different from the Earth that 
                        we know today, and may even be habitable for other forms of life (aliens) that have evolved to survive in such harsh 
                        conditions.
